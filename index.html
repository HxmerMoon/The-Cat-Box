			<h2>Purr-fect Hunters</h2>
			
			<p><span class = "bold">Cats</span>, also known as <span class = "italic">Felis catus</span>, are domesticated members of the cat family (<span class = "italic">Felidae</span>). This family can be broadly categorized into two groups: big cats that can roar (<span class = "bold">lions, tigers, leopards</span>) and smaller cats that purr (<span class = "bold">cougars, bobcats, and our furry companions, house cats</span>). Recent research suggests purring comes from a unique pad in their vocal cords that vibrates at low frequencies.</p>

			<p>Domestic cats are known for their sharp senses, retractable claws, muscular bodies, long tails, and specialized teeth â€“ all perfectly designed for hunting small animals.</p>

			<h2>Fur-fect Costumes</h2>
			
			<p>Cat appearances are quite diverse! While many cats have spotted, striped, or rosette patterned fur, others, like pumas, jaguarundis, and lions, have a solid coat color. Black fur is also common across various cat species.</p>

			<p>Tail length varies too. Unlike lynxes with their short tails, most cats have long tails reaching about a third of their body length. Their heads are typically round with short noses and ears. The one exception is the male African lion, easily recognized by its impressive mane.</p>

			<p>Sharp, retractable claws are another common feature, except for cheetahs who lack this ability. Finally, size differences between genders are frequent, with males generally being larger than females in most cat species.</p>

			<h2>Clawing for Attention</h2>
			
			<p>Cats have a surprisingly wide range of vocalizations for such seemingly quiet creatures. They purr to express contentment, while growls, howls, and hisses erupt during conflicts with other cats. "Big cats" like lions take this a step further with roars, growls, and shrieks. Despite this diverse vocabulary, cats often communicate silently.</p>
			
			<p>Many cats are drawn to scratching posts, leaving distinct marks with their claws. The exact reason for this behavior remains a subject of debate. Some believe it's for sharpening claws, while others see it as a way to stretch or even a form of communication.  Interestingly, even kittens raised in isolation instinctively begin clawing objects, suggesting it's an innate behavior in these furry enigmas.</p>
